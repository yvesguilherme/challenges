### Build the Application

```bash
./gradlew build
```

### Run the Application

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:8080/v1`.

## API Endpoints

docker run -p 8080:8080 desafio-itau-statistics
```

## Observability

The application includes endpoints for health checks and application info:

- **Health Check:** `GET /v1/actuator/health`
- **Application Info:** `GET /v1/actuator/info`

## Logging
